	<h1><b>Eletronic Dance Music</b>	</h1>  <p>aka.EDM</p>
	<h2>Defintion:</h2>
	<p id="defintion">
	>Electronic dance music (EDM), also known as dance music, club music, or simply dance is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves and festivals. <br/>
	It is generally produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. <br/>
	EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA.<br/>
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radios and an upsurge of interest in club culture,<br/>
EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal;<br/>
 although both electro and Chicago house music were influential both in Europe and the United States, mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained openly hostile to it. <br/>
 There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture, which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, largely in Australia and the United States.<br/>
 By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance music" and the initialism "EDM" was being pushed by the American music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture.<br/>
 Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, hardstyle, and trap, as well as their respective subgenres.</p>

<h1>Career</h1>
<p id="career">
<ul>
<li>
Martin Garrix’s career as an Electronic Dance Music (EDM) star began at 14, when he served as a disc jockey at his high school dance. After meeting Tiësto and having him as a mentor, he released his first tracks, ‘BFAM’ (with Julian Jordan) and ‘Just Some Loops’ (with TV Noise). In 2012, he released ‘Error 404’ (with Jay Hardway), his first track through ‘Spinnin' Records’. The following year he released ‘Torrent’ (with Sidney Samson) on Tiësto’s own label, Musical Freedom. Released as a digital download on June 16, 2013, his first mega hit, ‘Animals’, was also his first solo work. The track topped multiple listings in Europe. It also helped Garrix become the youngest person with a song that climbed to the No.1 spot on the electronic music store ‘Beatport’.</li>
<li>
His second collaboration with Hardway, ‘Wizard’ was released on 2 December 2013. The song was later used in the film ‘Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014)’. ‘Helicopter’ (a collaborative effort between Garrix and Firebeatz) was ranked No.1 on the Beatport chart for two consecutive weeks. In early 2014, he headlined the‘Ultra Music Festival’ for the first time. On February 6, 2015, he released his first progressive house track ‘Forbidden Voices’, a distinct departure from his usual big room sound. In the same month he worked with Usher on the single ‘Don’t Look Down’. He played the song ‘Rewind Repeat It’ featuring Ed Sheeran at the Ultra Music Festival in 2015 in Miami.</li>
<li>
The mid-2015 saw his exit from ‘Spinnin' Records’ over a contention about the ownership of his music. In early 2016 he launched ‘STMPD RCRDS’, and through the label he released his new track ‘Now That I’ve Found You’. His promotional single ‘Opps’, released on June 13, 2016, was picked as the ‘Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016’ anthem. His contract signing with ‘Sony Music’ came about on July 26, 2016. Garrix and singer Troye Sivan performed their collaborative song ‘There For you’ at the ‘2017 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival in California. He is now all set to support Justin Bieber at the 'Barclaycard presents British Summer Time Hyde Park' show in July 2017. He has also made two appearances on ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’ as a music guest, first in 2016, and then again in 2017.</li>
